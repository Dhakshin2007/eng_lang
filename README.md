# 🗣️ EnglishLang – A Programming Language in Plain English

> Write programs like you're writing English. No confusing syntax. Just pure logic, the way you speak.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**EnglishLang** is a beginner-friendly interpreted programming language written in Python. It is designed to help new programmers and even non-coders write logic in plain, natural English.

This language is not just an experiment — it’s a bridge between human thought and computational power.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Variable assignment: `Let name be "Dhakshin"`
- ✅ Arithmetic operations: `Add a and b into total`
- ✅ List creation & indexing: `List fruits: "apple", "banana"`
- ✅ Loops: `While x is less than 10`
- ✅ Functions: Define and call with arguments
- ✅ Print commands: `Print "Hello" and name`
- ✅ Case-insensitive parsing (`Let`, `let`, `LET` all work)
- ❌ If/Else, return values – coming soon!

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/englishlang.git
cd englishlang
```

### 2. Write EnglishLang Code

Inside the `scripts/` folder, create a file like `example.eng` with this code:

```english
Let name be "Dhakshin"
Print "Hello" and name

Let a be 10
Let b be 15
Add a and b into sum
Print "Sum is" and sum
```

### 3. Run Your File

```bash
python main.py scripts/example.eng
```

That's it — your English program runs!

## 📘 Full Syntax (Supported So Far)

```english
Let age be 17
Let name be "Dhakshin"

Add age and 3 into newAge
Print "You will be" and newAge

List fruits: "apple", "banana"
Add "grape" to fruits
Print fruits at 2
Length of fruits into count
Print count

Define greet name:
  Print "Hello," and name
  Print "You are awesome!"
END

Call greet with "Dhakshin"

Let x be 1
While x is less than 5
  Print "Value is" and x
  Add x and 1 into x
END
```

You can also refer to [`syntax.md`](syntax.md) for complete documentation.

## 🧪 Examples

### ✅ Sample Program

```english
Let name be "Dhakshin"
Print "Welcome" and name
```

### ✅ Function Definition and Call

```english

```

### ✅ Loop

```english
Let x be 0
While x is less than 3
  Print "X is" and x
  Add x and 1 into x
END
```
